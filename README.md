## About Move Language

Move is a smart contract programming language developed by Diem (formerly known as Libra), a blockchain project launched by Facebook in 2019. Move is designed to provide a safe and secure programming environment for building decentralized applications on the Diem blockchain.

The Move language is built with a focus on security and correctness, with a type system that allows for modular, reusable code. Move is also designed to support formal verification, which is a process of mathematically proving the correctness of a program's behavior. This makes Move an ideal language for building secure financial applications such as payment systems, stablecoins, and other financial tools.
